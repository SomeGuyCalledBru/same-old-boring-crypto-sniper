The title is enough of an explanation for what it is, I won't delve deeper in that.

## How to run it?
After installing the necessary libraries(web3, pyperclip, webbrowser, flask), run main.py. It will open a browser window where you can do your stuff. 
Make sure port 19155 is free on loopback.

## What networks/chains are possible?
```
Network -> DEx
ropsten: uniswap
bsc_mainnet: pancakeswap_v2, biswap
ftm_mainnet: spiritswap, spookyswap
avax_mainnet: traderjoe, pangolin
cronos_mainnet: crodex, photonswap, cronical, cronoswap
moonbeam_mainnet: solarflare, dustydunes, padswap, stellaswap
```
## Is there a cost to it?
It's "free" to use, except that you have a 1% fee taken at every transaction.

### There's a good bit more to document, but I'm too lazy to do them now
