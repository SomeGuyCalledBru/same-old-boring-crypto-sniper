The title is enough of an explanation for what it is, I won't delve deeper in that.

## How do you run it?
After installing the necessary libraries(web3, pyperclip, webbrowser, flask), run main.py. It will open a browser window where you can do your stuff.\
Make sure TCP port 9545 is free on loopback.

## Which networks/chains are supported?
```
Network -> DEx
ropsten: uniswap
bsc_mainnet: pancakeswap_v2, biswap
ftm_mainnet: spiritswap, spookyswap
avax_mainnet: traderjoe, pangolin
cronos_mainnet: crodex, photonswap, cronical, cronoswap
moonbeam_mainnet: solarflare, dustydunes, padswap, stellaswap
```

## Is there a cost to it?
It's "free" to use, except that you have a 1% fee taken at every transaction.

## I have an idea/issue to report!
Open an issue in this repository. Issues are welcome if you put effort to it.

## Which versions/branches are there?
  * `main`: Changes go live on the spot. Most unstable, but also the most up to date.
  * `beta`: More polished versions of new features and versions. Still not stable enough for constant use.
  * `stable`: Most polished and thoroughly tested version. Late to get features, but best for those that want reliability.

## License?
GPLv3.
